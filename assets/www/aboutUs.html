About App
</h1>
<p>
Anchoring is a self-management
technique that is proven to help people
that suffer from panic attacks.
</p>
<p>
This technique is designed to add positive
associations to events that trigger an attack.
</p>
<p>
Anchoring involves three steps:
</p>
<h1>
Step 1 - Visualization
</h1>
<p>
Think of a time and place that you felt most
happy.
</p>
<p>
Hold it big and clear in your mind.
</p>
<h1>
Step 2 - Anchor it with a gesture
</h1>
<p>
With an image clear in your mind add a
gesture to anchor it.
</p>
<p>
This could be a touch or motion such as
rubbing the back of your hand or touching your
thumb and index finger.
</p>

<h1>
Step 3 - Reinforce it with a tell
</h1>
<p>
To help embed the anchor, repeat a short tell
and repeat it as you visualise and gesture.
</p>
<p>
A tell could be a couple of words or a short
phrase that helps to reinforce the new anchor.
</p>
<p>
When used together, these three steps form a
powerful tool to help people overcome times
of high anxiety and panic.
</p>
